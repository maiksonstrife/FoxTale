## Other Techniques to Improve Gameplay
- [x] Ghost Jump (A quick timer when player falls of the ground: It does not penalize too much on mistake by giving a small window to still be able to jump)
- [x] Flash Sprites (Visual response to the game damage feedback)
- [x] Smooth Camera (using linear interpolation)
- [x] Camera moving ahead of player (when player changes direction the camera position goes a little ahead to his facing position)
- [x] Screenshake (visual response to the game feedback)
